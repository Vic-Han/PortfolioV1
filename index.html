                            I am currently completing my Computer Science degree at the University of Calgary and aspire to become a cloud/web developer. 
                            In addition to my degree, I am in the process of earning an IBM Full Stack Developer certificate.

                            Right now my primary focus is my Recipe-Selector project, where I am trying to master React, Express, and MongoDB. 
                            I also plan to become proficient in technologies such as Rust, Django, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes. 
                            To further my learning, I have several other projects and online courses lined up.

                            I'm obsessed with pushing myself as far as I can. I firmly believe that our biggest limits are the ones we put on ourselves.
                            Ultra running is my way of stepping as far outside of my comfort zone as possible.
                            It's how I show myself that I truly am someone who won't give up, no matter what.
                            It's my philosophy that being confident can change everything we do, and that we earn this confidence by overcoming our self doubts. 
                            While all endurance sports are challenging and lead to moments of self-doubt, I believe running is the most brutal.

                            I was inspired by a coworker to attempt a 100km bike ride. 
                            At the time, it seemed impossible as my longest ride had only been 40km! 
                            However, as I continued to train, I quickly realized how foolish my doubts were. 
                            While 5-hour training sessions were too stressful on my body when running, cycling allowed me to do so every weekend. 
                            I often set ambitious time goals, and I was forced to find another level of effort during these rides.
                            I learned the power of being able to talk myself through a difficult situation, whether on the road or in real life.

                            I have to be honest, my love for cooking originated from my own disastrous meals. 
                            I used to equate 'healthy' with 'unappetizing', and believed that consuming bland food was a necessary sacrifice for my fitness. 
                            However, as I did more and more research into healthy meals, I discovered that most delicious dishes can be made from scratch with whole foods. 
                            I'm far from a chef, but I take pride in my ability to whip up a nutritious recipe that not only tastes great but is also pratical to prepare.

                            SpaceBook started off as just a "facebook" pun in my head, but when I mentioned it to my group they were immediately on board. 
                            Seeing as none of my other group members had experience or confidence in full stack software design, I took charge of building the majority of the architecture for the software. 
                            I ended up learning a lot from my mistakes in both designing the database, choosing information flow, and client side caching. 
                            I gained a lot of experience with project management when it comes to full stack applications.

                            Learn the MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack from scratch! How hard can that be 🤣
                            Anyways, I decided the best way to learn was to build a project from scratch, which I still believe to be true.
                            However, I was quickly humbled by Reacts steep learning curve,  
                            and I learned that there's a lot more to a full stack application than just the front end and back end. 
                            Right now I have a working prototype, but I'm iterating on the user experience before I finish programming the rest of the features.
