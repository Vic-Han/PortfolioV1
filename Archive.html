        <h3> Software Design </h3>
        <p> I love the process of designing software.
            I believe that many there exist many good solutions for one problem, and that the best design is not obvious.
            This requires problem solving and the ability to think at different levels of abstraction.

        <h3> Computational Problems and Algorithms</h3>
        <p> I was hooked immediately after I started.
            The process requires you to use examples, get a feel for the problem, then try some strategies. 
            Algorithms that fail will give you more insights into the problem and it's edge cases. 
            Sometimes you need to think about the problem in a completely different way in order to solve it. 
            I appreciate this process, I consider designing complex algorithms an art.

        <h3> Endurance Sports</h3>
        <p> I love endurance/long distance sports.
            It allows me to get outside my comfort zone and I often times find myself in situations where I desperately want to give up.
            Being able to perservere in these moments means 
            a lot to me and helps me stay confident in my ability to tackle any obstacle, inside or outside sports.
            I love both distance running and road cycling, I plan to get into triathlon at some point in the future.

        <h3> Chess </h3>
        <p> Chess requires practice, creativity, and logical thinking.
            I used to play competively when I was younger; I still play recreationally and follow top level chess.
